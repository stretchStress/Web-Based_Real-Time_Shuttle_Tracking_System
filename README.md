# Web-Based Real-Time Shuttle Tracking System for Alcedon Transport Corp.

## Project Overview

This capstone project focuses on the design and development of a **Web-based Real-time Shuttle Tracking System** for **Alcedon Transport Corp.** The purpose of this system is to enhance shuttle management by providing accurate, real-time information regarding shuttle locations, routes, pick-up points, estimated time of arrival (ETA), driver performance, and vehicle maintenance. The system aims to support efficient decision-making and improve overall service quality.

## Objectives of the Study

### General Objective

To create a Web-based Real-time Shuttle Tracking System for Alcedon Transport Corp. that improves shuttle management through accurate tracking, route analysis, performance evaluation, and user feedback.

### Specific Objectives

1. Develop a user-friendly, responsive web-based system compatible with desktop and mobile devices that enables real-time tracking of shuttle vehicles.
2. Implement a real-time GPS tracking system to monitor shuttle locations and minimize delays.
3. Create an administrative dashboard for transportation managers to monitor shuttle status, assign drivers, assess route efficiency, and manage shuttle maintenance.
4. Integrate data analytics functionalities to generate reports on driver performance and shuttle usage patterns.
5. Establish a feedback mechanism that allows users to report issues, suggest improvements, and rate their transportation experience to support continuous service improvement.
6. Design an interactive map visualization to display shuttle routes, current vehicle locations, and estimated arrival times.
7. Develop a secure user system with role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure data protection and appropriate access for administrators, drivers, and employees.
8. Evaluate the proposed software through end-user feedback based on the following ISO/IEC 25010:2023 quality characteristics:
   - Functional Suitability
   - Performance Efficiency
